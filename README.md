<summary>How To Play - Recipes and More</summary>

## HOW TO PLAY
(Recipes mentioned can be viewed in the gallery)
### Making tools:
If you try to play Minecraft normally with this modpack, you will first notice that you can't mine a tree. **Wood requires a tool to be mined**. Since you can't mine trees without tools, there are now **flint tools instead of wooden tools**. They are crafted like normal tools but with flint instead of wood. **Using those planks, You can craft a wooden plank with four sticks and a crafting table.** Gravel and leaves drop items more often to make it easier to collect these materials in the early game. The next step is to make stone tools. This won't be as easy as those flint tools. **To make stone tools, craft hard stone, and surround your flint tools with 4 hard stones on a crafting table. A hard stone is crafted by surrounding 4 hostile mob drops around a normal stone**. Remember to use normal stone, not cobblestone. **To make diamond and iron tools, surround an iron or stone pickaxe with 4 diamond or iron blocks in a crafting table**.

### Additional information:

 - **Beds are crafting using cloth,** a new drop from zombies. It is the normal recipe with 3 cloth above it.
 - **You start with 5 hearts**, and armor can give you more hearts. A full set will give you normal vanilla hearts.
 - **Soup heals you** and can be crafted using cacti!
 - **There are no villages or villagers** so don't try finding any.
 - **Minecarts go faster**, and elytras are boosted using on-the-ground campfires instead.
 - **Fishing** is buffed.
 - **Seasons** are a thing and will affect crop growth.
 - **Bats drop phantom membranes**, and phantoms are removed from the game.
 - **You can craft a backpack** with 6 leather and 2 string, see [this](https://modrinth.com/mod/beans-backpacks) for more info about backpacks.
- **Mobs will be more difficult to fight** when you get more advancements.
